    "There are a couple of problems right now. first, the training isnt stable. This might be due to many things, there could be some catastrophic forgetting happening here, or it might just be the limit of the vanilla dqn, or it might just be that the environment is too random, or that the reward function is not good enough, maybe a bit of hyperparameter tuning might be good enough to solve the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of questions that remain from this implementation: is the experience replay working? is the pipeline working? does the environment work? this will take a while to figure out.\n",
    "\n",
    "concerning the reward function, maybe giving negative reward when the agent is on the negative on a trade is good, enforcing early stopping through the reward function might be a good idea.\n",
    "\n",
    "other solutions might involve implementing the target network, hyperparameter tuning, like the observation size, the replay memory size, the neural network size/ arquitecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "however, there is no doubt that im going to have to try other algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "*I did the sum of the scores, and it seems that it ends up positive. this is an indicator that the algorithm might actually be working? Ill have to test and average over multiple runs to see if this is actually the case. thought this beings up an interesting question, I sort of expected the shape of the graph to be trending towards positive, but now that I think about it it seems obvious that that might never be the case, and its not necessarily a bad thing, you cant expect the algorithm to have a positive trade every time, just like with people, it is normal to have bad trades, but its the average return that determines if the trader is proficient or not. And just like this, you cant expect an algorithm to always have positive returns. in conclusion, the metric for success is not only the shape of the graph, but the overall return from the whole training procedure; by doing the sum of all the scores \"sum(scores)\" and the higher the number  the better, and then doing an average over multiple training loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "*There is another idea that has to be investigated, should the agent be always \"greedy\" when deployed to production or should you always have a non zero epsilon? and should the agent still have a learning call or should you stop learning when the agent is deployed?\n",
    "\n",
    "*And finally the question of transfer learning, will it be possible? the training environment would have to be very close to the actual production environment for it to work. unless I come up with some revolutionary way to do transfer learning in rl (not likely)."
